Welcome! I'm a PhD candidate studying at Australian Center for Space Engineering Research([ACSER](https://www.acser.unsw.edu.au/)). I'm expecting to graduate in mid-2022. Generally, my current research focuses on two fields: 1) Off-Earth mining and Space Resources Utilisation  2) Artificial Intelligence in space mission design and optimisation. My past experience includes: 1) GNC algorithms 2) High accuracy attitude determination for agile remote sensing satelite 3) Star sensor and gyroscope online/offline calibration.

This site is under construction. I'll update my intro, experiences regularly. I'll also release source code and my research date here.
