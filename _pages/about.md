Hi! I'm a PhD candidate studying at Australian Center for Space Engineering Research ([ACSER](https://www.acser.unsw.edu.au/)), University of New South Wales, Sydney. I'm expecting to graduate in mid-2022. Generally, my current research focuses on three fields: 
* Off-Earth mining and Space Resources Utilisation  
* Artificial Intelligence in space mission design and optimisation. 
* Trajectory optimisation. 

My past experience includes: 
* GNC algorithms 
* High accuracy attitude determination for agile remote sensing satelite 
* Star sensor and gyroscope online/offline calibration, etc.
