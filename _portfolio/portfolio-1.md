# Objective 
The long-term goal of this project is to developed a web-based, data driven, 3-D interactive visualisation system tool to provide illustration of: 1) Major and small bodies' movements in the solar system 2) Off-Earth mining illustration.

# Introduction
Currently, all available asteroids listed in NASA small bodies database are added into the system. The movements of these bodies are based on two-body system dynamics. You may use the "Data and Control" panel to display asteroids of interests - Or you may use the "Asteroid Clusters" panel to display a particular group of asteroids. When playing with these control bars, you can observe some interesting movements, clusters, etc.
